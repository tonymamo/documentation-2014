<h1>Object-Oriented CSS (OOCSS)</h1>
<h2 id="what-is">What is OOCSS?</h2>
<p>
	Object Oriented CSS is a new way of thinking about how we author
	CSS files to make them small, efficient, flexible, and maintainable.
	The objective of OOCSS is to recognize patterns within the design, and
	abstract that pattern. By doing this, we reuse bits of CSS and
	avoid repeating ourselves unnecessarily within a style sheet.</p>
    
<p>A classic example of this is the  horizontal list. Between navigation, breadcrumbs, 
    and menus, most sites tend to have at least one or two horizontal lists. 
    Normally, you would create classes for each list, and set the CSS property of
	<code>display: inline-block;</code>, or <code>float: left;</code>
	for each list. Why repeat this in our CSS? What
	happens when we need another horizontal list? The issue 
    compounds each time another version of a list is added. 
    OOCSS (built on the <abbr title="Dont Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr> 
    (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle), provides a method of eliminating  
    unnecessary code.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use OOCSS</h2>
<p>
	Getting started with OOCSS doesn't require learning any new CSS or
	HTML, but rather learning to think differently in how one crafts their
	style sheets.
</p>
    
<p>
    The first step is to look at a page, whether it is a 
	wireframe, design comp, or existing web page, and recognize the patterns that
	are being shared amongst different elements. Perhaps there are two or
	three colors, a box with an image on the left and content on the right,
	a border around different boxed elements, multiple horizontal lists,
	and more. Once you recognize these patterns, it is easy to see how a
	<code>property: value;</code>
	pair would be used multiple times on different elements, when in effect
	you are just repeating yourself unnecessarily. CSS is meant to cascade
	and be reusable, and the OOCSS methodology embraces that notion to
	leverage it the way it was supposed to be.
 </p>

<p>
    Once we recognize these patterns, the next step is to abstract 
    these <code>property: value;</code> pairs into their own class. 
    This is called your abstraction, or sometimes referred to as a base 
    object or module. Optimallly, an abstraction should be basic and free of 
    design-related styling, so that it can be <em>extended</em> with appended classes.
	This makes for extremely reusable code that is much easier to maintain
	in the future. It also allows for quick and easy reskinning or theming
	of a page without affecting other parts of a page.
</p>

<p>    
    To make better sense of this, we can make an analogy of objects and Legos. 
    Imagine the different Lego shapes and their variations, but imagine them without
	color for a moment. These are analogous to base objects, or abstractions. They 
    can be assembled in different ways, but contain the basic building blocks for 
    limitless creations. Now, reintroduce your colors and variations of those Legos, 
    which are like the extensions, or appending classes, that can be used to change 
    the entire look and feel of a project.
</p>

<p>    
    A practical example is how 
	<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#buttons">Twitter
	Bootstrap</a> handles their button styling. They have a grey button called
	<code>.btn</code>
	as their base object, which sets the rudimentary styling like padding,
	a simple background, the borders, text-shadow, and a little bit more.
	Then, you can <em>extend</em> the look of that base object button by
	adding supplementary appended classes to
	<code>.btn</code>
	to change both color and size. For example, you can have
	<code>&lt;button class="btn btn-primary btn-large"&gt;</code>
	, where the last two classes extended the first class. The first class
	set the base styling, the second class changed the color scheme, and
	the third changed the size. By leaving the base object mostly
	design-agnostic, it was able to take on these extensions without having
	to overwrite, or even worse, over-qualify it with more specificity to
	change the entire look and feel of it. 
</p>

<p>        
    Between the 6 different color extensions and 3 different size extensions 
    available in Bootstrap, you end up with 28 different potential results (base 
    color + 6 extensions &times; Base size + 3 extensions). This is only 10 classes, as opposed
	to 28 classes had they been all written out separately. Think about how
	much file size was saved by reusing code instead of repeating it for
	each of the 28 different rulesets. This multi-class pattern of a base
	abstraction plus extensions is where OOCSS really shines.
</p>

<h2 id="habits">Breaking Good Habits</h2>

<p>
	By using OOCSS, we need to shift our thinking around what was used to
	be considered "best practices" in CSS. As HTML and CSS have progressed
	throughout the years, we have adopted some ideas around what makes for
	good and bad code, but when is the last time we really stepped back and
	analyzed <em>why</em> or <em>what</em> makes something good or bad?
</p>

<p>    	
    Lately, we considered good habits to be avoiding using a lot of
	classes, using the least amount of markup possible to acheive
	something, and handcrafting our CSS. Conversely, the bad habits were
	"classitis", unsemantic class names, and being too verbose with markup.
	It may take some time to change our mindset, but these methods have now been proven 
    to actually be less efficient, and there is now proof to debunk these bad habits.
</p>

<ol>
	<li><h3>Avoiding Extra Classes/Classitis</h3>
		<p>
			Contrary to popular belief, being generous with your classing
			everything can result in less markup and smaller CSS filesize. It
			seems counterintuitive, but if done properly (using OOCSS), file size
			can dramatically decrease even though there are more classes
			declared. The difference comes in when you are applying the 
			<abbr title="Dont Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr> approach, and only state
			<code>property: value;</code>
			pairs a minimal number of times. So now, instead of a value being
			repeated numerous times in a stylesheet, it is only written once, and
			shared via class names. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            A memorable statistic that came out of 
			<a 	href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/" title="Media Object by Nicole Sullivan">Nicole Sullivan's research</a> 
			is how Facebook repeated the hex code for "Facebook Blue" a
			total of 261 times, in stylesheets that were Megabytes in size. If
			done correctly using OOCSS, there is no reason that number could have
			been less than 10. They may need to define it as a
			<code>background-color:;</code>
			,
			<code>color:;</code>
			, and
			<code>border:;</code>
			, but really not much more than that if at all. By embracing the
			cascade and letting CSS do the heavy lifting, they could have easily
			reduced their file size by at least 200 lines of code that were just
			stating the same hex value. After Nicole Sullivan and her research
			partners recoded a sample homepage of Facebook using abstractions and
			extensions, they were able to reduce the file size of the markup by
			almost 50% and the CSS by around 20%. In the end, there were actually
			more class names than before, but there were no styles that were
			based on an element and its position in the markup.</p>
        <p class="columize">    
            By not styling on
			an element, all specificity wars were eliminated, and the CSS became
			much more maintainable, flexible, extensible, and predictible, all
			while being much smaller in filesize.
		</p></li>
	<li><h3>Unsemantic Class Naming</h3>
		<p>
			When it comes to naming a class, it doesn't matter if it is semantic or not.
			Class names are primarily used for
			hooks in CSS and JS, and make sense only to us developers. Of course,
			our markup should be as semantic as possible, because it will get
			interpreted by not only other developers, but by search engines,
			accessibility devices, and more. When it comes to classes, it only
			makes sense to talk about them in terms of <em>sensible</em> and <em>insensible</em>.
			They must make sense to us as a developer, and not need an
			explanation of what they mean. 
        </p>
        
        <p>    
            Refer to <a href="/css-best-practices.shtml">CSS Best Practices</a> 
			for more on naming conventions. To summarize, it is best to name a class based
			on what it does, not what it looks like, where it is located, or other contextual-based
			names.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><h3>Using IDs in CSS</h3>
		<p>Using IDs in a stylesheet should be avoided at all costs. They may be used in markup to serve as a hook for Javascript, but there is definitely no need for them to be used as a styling hook. They have no advantage over using a class; anything that can be styled with an ID can be done with a class.</p> 
		<p>The problem with using them in CSS is because they go against the very nature of CSS itself: they are not reusable, and they introduce a high level of specificity, not unlike using <code>!important</code>. It is pretty hard to qualify a selector to be stronger than an ID, which means you will just be introducing highly over-qualified and long selector chains that go all the way up the DOM tree just to be stronger than an ID. Instead, why not use a class, which could then be reused later on, and also make your stylesheet more maintainable and extensible? By using a class over an ID, you are making your own and everyone else's lives easier in the future by avoiding the dreaded "Specificity Wars".</p>
	</li> 
</ol>

<h2 id="together">Putting It All Together</h2>
<p>	The main goal of OOCSS is to achieve the highest code quality possible. Before, that meant ensuring correctness, reliability, reusability, performance, testability, and extensibility. Now, with OOCSS, those all still apply, but come naturally when writing CSS with optimization for change in mind.</p> 
	<p>That means, while crafting your CSS, you anticipate maintenance later on, whether by you or another developer. If you do this correctly, all of those others will fall in line. 
</p>

<h3>Tips &amp; Tricks</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Write CSS that has a 1:Many relationship with HTML elements. This ensures flexibility and that you are keeping your code <abbr title="Dont Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>.</li>
	<li>Write rulesets in order of specificity. This means instead of the order they occur in the markup, or just tacking on lines of code at the end of the file, that you order them by inheritance strength. 
		Ideally, the base objects/abstractions come first, then extensions, and then various other classes. Subsequent rulesets should only inherit, not undo, something from higher up in the stylesheet (with minor exceptions).</li>
	<li>Avoid over-qualifying your selectors by putting an element before the class (e.g. <code>ul.nav</code> instead of just <code>.nav</code>). It increases specificity, limits reusability, and is less efficient. Unlike us, CSS is processed by browsers
	from right to left, so it will look for all <code>.nav</code> and then for one inside of a <code>ul</code>, which takes much longer than just <code>.nav</code>.</li>
	<li>Avoid unnecessary nesting and chaining of selectors in the stylesheet. Again, this will increase specificity, and becomes less efficient because it takes longer for the browser to parse. Also, it becomes less portable because it depends on HTML structure. The goal is to make selectors independent of structure so they can be reused elsewhere.</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Understanding the Layers of CSS</h3>
<p>Andy Hume gave a presentation on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/andyhume/p/css-for-grown-ups-maturing-best-practises">maturing best practices</a> in which he describes how CSS actually works in different layers. To create good OOCSS code, he explains how 
	abstractions and extensions should be written in a way that only affects one layer at a time, and provides a few examples of how it works. The four layers are the <strong>HTML Document</strong>, <strong>Base</strong>, <strong>Module</strong>, and <strong>Layout</strong>.
	If done correctly, what this essentially does is separate content and presentation.
</p>

		<h4>Example of Layers of CSS</h4>
<div class="row-fluid">
	<div class="span6">
		<p>For this example, let's assume we have a module on our page for a promotional feature. We will call it <code>.promo-box</code> and give it some basic styling. Right now, the styles we have are only affecting the Module itself, 
		and not "bleeding" out and being inherited by anything else, since they don't have the same class.</p>
		<p>Now, let's assume you want to style the <code>h3</code> inside of the <code>.promo-box</code>. As the code on line 6 illustrates, it is pretty straightforward: We can just target the <code>h3</code> inside of the <code>.promo-box</code> module. However, by chaining these two selectors together,
			we have now added higher specificity, less portability, and dependance on code structure for this to work. By doing this, we are now affecting the module (by declaring <code>.promo-box</code>) and the document (by declaring <code>h3</code>).</p>
		<p>In the future, what happens if we need to added an <code>h4</code> to the <code>.promo-box</code>? Traditionally we would add a new selector to our code (lines 11 - 12), hopefully avoiding some redundancy by chaining the selectors. This does not, however, simplify our code, but rather continues to bloat our CSS with more selectors, resulting in more long-term maintenance issues.</p>
		<p>To avoid these types of specific contextual selectors, we can create a class which can be added to any <code>hN</code> element (or any element for that matter). Yes, it means adding more classes in the markup, but it lowers the specificity of the selectors and makes the style more portable. On line 17, you can see the newly created class.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="span6">
<figure>
	<pre class="codeSample prettyprint lang-css linenums">
.promo-box { /* affects only MODULE layer */
    color: #333;
    background: #ddd;
}

.promo-box h3 { /* now affects both MODULE &amp; Document (h3's) */
    font-size: 1.2em;
    ...
}

.promo-box h3,
.promo-box h4 {
    font-size: 1.2em;
    ...
}

.promo-box-h { /* only affects MODULE! */
    font-size: 1.2em;

<h1>Examples of OOCSS</h1>
<h2 id="record-set">The Record Set Abstraction</h2>
<div class="row-fluid">
	<div class="span7">
				<p>
			<a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/" title="Media Object by Nicole Sullivan">Nicole Sullivan pioneered</a> 
			one of the most useful abstractions, and kickstarted the
			whole OOCSS approach with her work. After analyzing Facebook, she
			realized that the UI layer followed a pretty basic pattern with an
			image or icon on the left, followed by some text or other content on
			the right. By abstracting this pattern, she was able to write just a
			few lines of code that would allow it to be infinitely nestable, have
			multiple configurations, and it must clearfix. It should also be able
			to have different widths, have no styling associated besides layout,
			and be agnostic about the content inside it. By doing so, hundreds of
			lines of repeated code was eliminated, and saw a file size reduction
			of close to 50%.
		</p>
		

		<p>Since we have a similar set up &#8212; image on the left, user's name on the right, and supplementary content &#8212; We have built upon this idea and have created the "Record Set" abstraction.
        </p>

		<p>
			The abstraction requires just one wrapping element with the class
			<code>.record</code> applied to it. Inside is the optional content section
			<code>.record-body</code>. In the CSS, first everything gets a little
			padding and margin, which may change according to each project. Next,
			we create some clearfixing properties using overflow, and some hacks
			for Internet Explorer. Finally, the image wrapper is floated left and
			given some margin on the right. This requires a class of
			<code>.img</code>
			on the wrapper, which will usually be a link.

    <h3>Body Text, Small Text, &amp; Giant Text</h3>

    		<p>In addition to headings, we want to set a typographic scale with the rest of our text, including normal body text, smaller text, and in some cases, 
    		extremely large text for banners or mastheads. For the body text, it should be set in the <code>html</code> tag and inherited for all elements like 
    		<code>p</code>, <code>li</code>, <code>table</code>, and so on. 16px is widely regarded as the best size to set the base size at for use on the web.</p>
    		<p><a href="http://csswizardry.com/2012/02/pragmatic-practical-font-sizing-in-css/" title="Pragmatic Font Sizing by Harry Roberts">Harry Roberts suggests in this article</a> using metric system prefixes to distinguish
    		between anything that is above or below the base typographic scale for headings and body text. For smaller text, instead of using <code>small</code>, it is best to abstract one or multiple classes to make smaller text sizes. 
    		We can also build on this idea for super large text sizes too. Some examples are in the following code.    		
    		</p>
    		<p>By abstracting font sizes, it also facilitates a vertical rhythm, achieved easily with consistent line heights and bottom margins in multiples 
    		of a <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/14/technical-web-typography-guidelines-and-techniques/#tt-magic-number" title="Technical Web Typography">magic number</a>. The magic number
    		is typically the base font size multiplied by line-height. Assuming a <code>line-height</code> of 1.5 and a base font size of 16, the magic number here is 24 (16 &times; 1.5 = 24). All <code>margin-bottom</code>s
    		can use this number, and line-height can be calculated based from this number as well, as shown in the code example.</p>
